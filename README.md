## Overview
This project is a simple webpage that allows users to search for makeup products using a Makeup API. The webpage will return information about the searched products including product name, brand name, tags like if the product is vegan or aluminum-free, an image of the product, and a link to where to buy the product. The interface will be a fun Bratz-inspired theme and will have a gradient background and match the aesthetic of the Bratz fashion Blog but for makeup
